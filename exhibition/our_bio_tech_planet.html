                            Plants, fungi and bacteria can do something that we humans are not able to – they create
                            networks
                            that provide optimal living conditions. For millions of years, they have perfected the
                            ability
                            to
                            build long-term relationships based on the distribution of goods. The forces of nature are
                            willingly
                            using network solutions. It is high time that we begin following their example.

                <p>
                    In the face of threats and challenges of the Anthropocene, when human activities exert a disruptive
                    influence over the environment, we turn to the roots – not only to metaphorical elements
                    constituting our heritage and ancestry, but to highly effective and resistant systems occurring in
                    the rhizosphere. Below the ground, where roots thrive, a vast number of interspecies cooperative
                    relationships are incessantly developing and sustaining a stable, plastic and incredibly adaptable
                    network. The <b>Small Worlds Network</b> model acts as the
                    rhizosphere’s operation system responsible for
                    resilience as well as distribution of resources. In this understanding, the rhizosphere may be
                    perceived as the source of inspiration for more sustainable organizational strategies and
                    solutions.<br><br>

                    So, how can we use the wisdom of the roots to improve the quality of life of all world beings and
                    wisely head towards what we want to become, towards the world in which we want to live? We are
                    looking into root systems and the communication of the rhizosphere actors in order to explore new
                    ways towards better management and democratization of resources, information and knowledge. The
                    exhibition involves interdisciplinary conversations, which aim to raise awareness of the
                    environmental and societal issues of our time. In this mutual exchange, artists are instigated by
                    new scientific research related to sustainable solutions, biotechnology and ecology. In turn,
                    scientists, bioengineers and stakeholders can engage in a creative, productive dialogue that may
                    lead towards fresh innovative developments as well as new ways of disseminating knowledge.<br><br>

                    Growing recognition of the functioning of the underground world based on symbiosis, diversity and
                    interdependence provides us with new perspectives. Looking at the interspecies, sustainable
                    relationships that cross the barriers of species, genera, classes or even domains helps us to
                    recognize the reality as a fully networked, complex and dynamic system. This, in turn, can lead to a
                    feeling of deeper bonding to the environment, as we find ourselves as part of a much bigger
                    “whole”.<br><br>

                    Learning about the complex networks that have been evolving for thousands of years provokes
                    reflection pointing to the high value of local connections, which in the human-made, globalized
                    system became in recent decades more and more marginalized. Observation of the decentralized,
                    effective model of small worlds of the rhizosphere may point to the new paths of development, guided
                    by fresh economic priorities, local communities’ empowerment and more fair resources & goods
                    exchange.<br><br>
                    We envisioned our global, human network as the rhizosphere, expanding not under our feet, but
                    everywhere around, entwining the Earth – a delicate network of symbiosis, diversity and
                    interdependencies. We connect and interact within this bio-tech planet, endlessly exchanging
                    information. Our actions influence the network’s well-being.<br><br>
                    The exhibition comprises two interdisciplinary projects: <b>Rhizosphere:
                        The Big Network of Small
                        Worlds</b> and <b>CHIC Project</b> (with <b>ASN Artists-in-Residence</b> Program), providing an

                    inspired by the research in the fields of life sciences and biotechnology. Rhizosphere is a
                    comprehensive art, research & education project evolved from a long-term cooperation between the

                    that guides the viewer inside the artworks. It serves as an introduction into the world of
                    inter-connections and creativity embracing artistic research & practice, scientific discovery and
                    technological progress.

                    <b> ART & SCIENCE NODE</b> app constitutes the meeting ground
                    between art and innovation in science and
                    technology, providing a wide survey of artworks created by artists inspired by scientific research
                    and collaborating with scientists in the field of life sciences and biotechnology. The AR projects
                    transfer the multitude of topics derived from biological inspirations, social issues, global
                    concerns and speculative reflections on the human-made systems onto multimedia narratives. <br><br>

                    Presentation in an augmented reality environment lets the viewer experience the artworks in the
                    self-chosen surroundings, without the enclosure within the walls of museums and galleries. Visit a
                    park, a meadow or a busy city street (and many more) and explore the variety of the artworks
                    outside.

                    <b>HOW DOES IT WORK?</b> <br>
                    1. Download and install the free ART & SCIENCE NODE application from Google Play/ App Store. It is
                    best to make the download when using Wi-Fi internet connection.<br>
                    2. When using the app – please remember to stay aware of your surroundings!<br>
                    3. Open the application. Before going in AR mode, check the Tutorial in the Menu to learn how to
                    fully enjoy the experience’s designed functionalities.<br>
                    4. After entering the AR mode, scan the horizontal surfaces and click on the chosen marker’s
                    position to place the root-like interface.<br>
                    5. Explore the interface and its nodes, each representing an original artwork. Choose the artworks
                    to display by clicking on the selected node.<br>
                    6. If the artwork is implemented with sound, you will see a relevant icon. We suggest using
                    headphones for the best audio experience.<br>

                    Both the world of soil-living fungi and the world of plants are built according to a similar
                    fundamental rule, which is <b>the creation of flexible network
                        relationships</b>. These associations have
                    both the structural and social dimensions that emerge from the morphology of the organs and tissues.
                    Underground mycelium is a tangle of threads, and its topology can easily be imagined as a network.
                    We learn this already in the first biology lessons. So, we agree that <b>the fungus body has a
                        network
                        structure.</b><br>
                    It turns out that the morphology of the vast majority of vascular plants – more than 80% of them –
                    should be seen similarly. Well, in addition to seed production, the way of plants is to grow their
                    territorial coverage through clonal reproduction, a method that fungi also commonly use. While
                    sexual reproduction creates a world of different individuals, clonal reproduction creates outgrowths
                    that are genetically identical to the parent organism and may not lose tissue continuity with it for
                    decades. In such a situation, it turns out that e.g. a poplar forest or a lawn section is not a
                    group of individuals but connected parts of one <b>plant, whose body
                        actually has a network structure</b>.

                    <b>Rhizosphere</b> <br><br>
                    Clonal colonies of plants or fungi form not only the largest living, but also the most long-lived
                    earthly organisms. Moreover, also those of them that were sowed out as separate beings, can organize
                    themselves into <b>meta-network relationships</b>. In fact, not only
                    they produce clonal networks but also
                    combine themselves into multi-species associations, in which they adopt mutually helpful cooperative
                    functions. Plant-fungal networks have enormous plasticity potential, which allows such associations
                    to persist in one place for hundreds or even thousands of years. The space in which plants cooperate
                    with local microbial communities is an extremely extensive <b>root zone
                        called the rhizosphere</b>.<br><br><br>
                    <b>Communication efficiency of the ‘small worlds’ model of biological networks</b> <br><br>
                    A distinctive feature of communication in biological networks is the lack of central management
                    nodes and cooperative interactions that shorten the operational distance between participants.
                    Relations with such a topology are referred to in mathematical models as ‘<b>networks of small
                        worlds</b>’
                    (Albert R, Jeong H, Barabási AL (2000) Error and attack tolerance of complex networks Nature
                    406:378-382). This term does not imply restrictions on resources redistribution. On the contrary,
                    despite the specialized diversity of participants, network dynamics is more intense and less
                    vulnerable to disorganization than in species-poor or deterministic models. <b>We can look in the
                        same
                        way at communication in the root system</b> of one plant, and in the extended version, also
                    within a
                    fungal network covering many plants. Due to its integrity and obligatory nature as well as
                    impressive cooperation, <b>the networked world of underground
                        communication</b> has been called as <b>Wood
                        Wide Web</b>.<br>

                    Today, various forms of mycorrhiza ensure the existence of 85% land plants around the world. This
                    fact inspired creation of a project about the communication between plants and humans. The art
                    project: <b>Mikoryzator</b> was initiated in 2014 by <b>Maria
                        Subczyńska</b>, then a student of the University of
                    Arts in Poznań, who was fascinated by the discovery of information on the existence of connections
                    of the mycorrhizal network in the context of the <b>Wood Wide Web</b>.
                    In further co-operation with <b>Piotr
                        Słomczewski</b>, the project has become an ever-growing interactive installation and the basis
                    of
                    various workshops and activities, stimulating cognitive and creative processes, as well as
                    supporting interpersonal communication and teamwork. (Inspired by an unusual underground world of
                    roots and fungi networks, an interactive art installation reflects on the uniqueness of natural
                    forms.)<br><br>
                    Four hundred million years ago, <b>arbuscular mycorrhiza</b> allowed
                    plants to leave the aquatic
                    environment and colonize land, and <b>today it ensures the existence of
                        85% of land plants on Earth</b>.
                    Its name comes from tree-branched hyphae called arbuscules, which are formed by the mycelium when
                    penetrating into the root cells. It is difficult to imagine the potential of the influence that
                    fungi have on the general condition of plants as well as their resistance to adverse environmental
                    changes: mycorrhizal symbiosis supplies the fungi with organic compounds. In return, arbuscules
                    provide plants with minerals and microelements.<br><br>
                    The hormones produced by fungi regulate plants’ development, and antibiotic substances secreted into
                    the soil protect them from pathogens, while plants’ phytohormones stimulate the growth of hyphae in
                    fungi. On the other hand, extracellular mycelium creates connections between the roots of nearby
                    plants of various species. The resulting structures, called <b>mycorrhizal networks</b>, enable the
                    transfer of nutrients and chemical information between plants, and also bind soil particles into
                    aggregates, stimulating soil-forming processes.<br><br>
