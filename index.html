					<b>Art & Science Node</b> (ASN) is a creative & innovative network aiming at and committed to the
					creation of
					the synergy between art, science and technology. It provides a platform to bring people of diverse
					backgrounds together in order to explore and generate new ideas and alternative perspectives on science
					and culture. ASN develops and supports transdisciplinary projects, international exhibitions, discussion
					panels as well as "artists in laboratories" residence programs and interdisciplinary workshops. ASN
					team, members and partners are professionals – theorists and practitioners from multiple organizations
					and institutions found all over the world. As we understand the public engagement and education to be
					one of the most important challenges for the art and science communities, we develop innovative
					communication strategies for the benefit of the society of knowledge.<br><br>

					We are becoming more and more aware that the structure of our reality is based on multiple, dynamic,
					interactive networks of constantly processed data: from neural networks to the World Wide Web; from
					the
					natural circulatory systems to social, economic and cultural phenomena. Various layers of the
					reality
					are interconnected with each other.
					Understanding of the world as a multi-faceted environment gave rise to the concept of an interface
					of a
					unique form that would serve as an introduction into the world of creativity, artistic research and
					practice, scientific discovery and technological progress. In presents both biological and digital
					characteristics, linking the physical and technological realities together.
					The interface has a nonhierarchical structure. In its form it refers to the root networks, while in
					its
					idea – to the Wood Wide Web concept of the underground world of connections and mutual exchange.

				<br>
				Rhizosphere: The Big Network of Small Worlds is an innovative and comprehensive program in the field
				of art-science education. It serves as a response to changes taking place in both our environment and
				the contemporary culture. The project was inspired by research on plant network strategies and the “Wood
				Wide Web” concept. It investigates the potential impact of the gained knowledge on the process of
				cultural paradigms change, increase of the ecological awareness and development of the social
				ecosystems. The implementation of the program is based on exploration and experiment; on
				inter-environmental co-operation; on knowledge and experience sharing.<br>
				The project was initiated with an inter-university cooperation between the <a style="color:#4f7043;"
					href="http://www.transdisciplinary-art.pl/" target="_blank">Studio for Transdisciplinary Projects
					and Research</a> at the Faculty of Artistic Education and Curatorial Studies of the University
				of Arts in Poznań and the <a style="color:#4f7043;" href="http://biologia.amu.edu.pl/"
					target="_blank">Faculty of Biology of the Adam Mickiewicz University</a> in Poznań, with the
				support and partnership by Art & Science Node. The network of the <b>Rhizosphere</b> projects and
				partners
				has been growing rapidly, with over 10 institutions, organizations and places involved in various
				activities.<br>
